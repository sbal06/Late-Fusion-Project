- The code files and README are currently being updated. 

## Description
The main contribution to the repository involves two methods of late fusion combining the image and text modalities.

A framework of late fusion is show below.

This respository also contains preprocessing methods to the image and text data for the [MVSA-Single dataset](https://mcrlab.net/research/mvsa-sentiment-analysis-on-multi-view-social-data/). 


## Future Improvements
1. Currently, we are trying to enhance out models by testing them on larger datasets.
2. We are also actively researching other fusion methods to enhance our model.
